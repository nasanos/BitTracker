# BitTracker

## What It Is
This is a simple desktop application (GTK# for the GUI) that gives Bitcoin's USD value, along with its percent change over the previous 24 hours, and a running list of the latest blockchain hashes. The data displayed is updated every 10 seconds. The application gets its data from two APIs: Bitcoin values from [GDAX](https://docs.gdax.com/) and blockchain updates from [Blockchain](https://blockchain.info/api).

The project is useful for crafting ways of interacting with and responding to information from live-updated APIs, as well as for toying with desktop GUIs.

## To Do
* Improve the UI with additional features and distinctions.
* Implement animations for data updates.
* Display additional information.
